	<h2>What is it</h2>
	<p>It's an attempt to do a well done real-time search for Mastodon. Something I miss from Twitter is to be able to search what people are talking about breaking news and other heated events</p>
	<p>
		This whole thing is provided as is.
	</p>
	<h2>Stats</h2>
	<p>At the moment it talks to <strong>{{ hosts }}</strong> and has <strong><format-number>{{ stats.count }}</format-number></strong> number of documents in database.</p>
	<h2>How it works</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>It listens to some instances local timelines via their API.</li>
		<li>It collects posts and keep them for a short time (currently <strong>{{ TOOTS_TTL_HUMAN }})</strong>.</li>
		<li>It only collects posts from authors that opt-in to search indexes (honors noindex flag).</li>
		<li>It sends User-Agent header with following value when calling instance APIs: Mozilla/5.0 (compatible; Masto.Kukei.eu-Bot/0.2; +https://masto.kukei.eu)</li>
	</ul>

	<h2 id="browse-disclaimer">
		Browse Disclaimer
	</h2>
	<p>/browse is an experimental browse page. You can browse by categories and/or languages.</p>
	<p>
		It is all a result of LLM processing using local Ollama models on my computer, Ollama.com cloud and/or using OpenAI compatible providers.
		Some posts are filtered out as I'm a chicken and I don't want risk showing something illegal here.
		Ergo, some posts that model considers "harmful" are being flagged as "banned" and not shown.
	</p>
	<p>To see how this works exactly, go to the source code to /scripts/make-categories.js</p>
	<h2 id="summaries">
		Summaries Disclaimer
	</h2>
	<p>Few times a day I take last 1000 posts in a previously assigned category (news, technology, programming), put it through AI to try to make a "summary of what people are talking about".</p>
	<p>I believe this is one of the "good things" about LLM, it can quickly make summaries, that are mostly correct, from a lot of content.</p>
	<p>I'm experimenting with it for some time and since I take all posts (in all languages), I find the biggest value from discovering topics that are out of my language bubbles.</p>
	<p>As the "browse" page, this is all experimental and I might sunset it without a notice.</p>

	<p>I do log queries due to abuse (some creeps are using this search to search for creepy stuff. It's not even here, but I keep banning them.</p>
	<p>I sometimes check logged queries, then I remove them.</p>
