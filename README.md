# Masto.kukei.eu website

## What is it
Thsi is a repo of a [masto.kukei.eu](https://masto.kukei.eu) website.

Kukei.eu is a real-time search engine for bunch of Mastodon instances.

It listens to public timelines, stores public (indexable) posts and keeps them for search for a short time before purging.

## I love the project, want to help
